# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction ML Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether an underwater object is a rock or a mine using machine learning. We utilized logistic regression as the classification algorithm for this task. The dataset consists of sonar signals reflected by underwater objects, and the goal is to build a model that can accurately classify these signals as either rocks or mines.


## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Darpanashree/SONAR-ROCK_VS_MINE_PREDICTION.git
   cd SONAR-ROCK_VS_MINE_PREDICTION
   ```
2. Create a virtual Environment
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3.Activate venv
  ```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for data exploration and model training.


- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and compare their performance.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better model accuracy.
- Conduct feature engineering to enhance the model's predictive power.
